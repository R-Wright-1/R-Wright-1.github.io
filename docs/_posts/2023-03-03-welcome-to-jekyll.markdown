My name is Robyn Wright, and I am currently a Mitacs postdoctoral research fellow in the Langille Lab (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University) and am researching the human microbiome in healthy and diseased individuals. I recently completed an Association of Commonwealth Universities Blue Charter Fellowship (October 2019-April 2020; School for Resources and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University) in which I carried out a meta-analysis of all studies that characterise the microbial communities that colonise plastics - the "Plastisphere". I am interested in microbial community dynamics and interactions; how are these communities impacted by different factors of their environments? How do they change over time? What functions are they capable of carrying out?
