I finished my PhD at the University of Warwick, UK, in Biological Sciences (microbial ecology) in October 2019 and have since held several different postdoctoral research fellow positions, primarily in the Langille Lab at Dalhousie University. Between January 2021 and December 2022, I was supported by an I3V-DMRF Dr. David H. Hubel postdoctoral fellowship and in January 2023 and again in April 2024 I was awarded a Mitacs Accelerate fellowship to work jointly between the Langille Lab and the Crosbie Lab at SickKids, Toronto.

My research interests lie in understanding the roles that microbial communities play in human and ecosystem health. This includes specific interests in: (i) evaluating the association between the microbiome and human health and disease; (ii) assessing and benchmarking the methods that we use to study microbial systems; (iii) interactions between microbial community members and how the undulations between cooperation and competition drive microbial community organisation and niche specialisation; (iv) isolating and characterising bacterial strains that are potentially able to remediate human or ecosystem health threats; and (v) understanding the evolution of mechanisms for microbial growth and persistence.
