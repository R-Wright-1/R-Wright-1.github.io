My name is Robyn Wright, and I am currently a Mitacs postdoctoral research fellow in the Langille Lab (Department of Pharmacology, Dalhousie University) and am researching the human microbiome in healthy and diseased individuals. 

Prior to this, I completed an Association of Commonwealth Universities Blue Charter Fellowship (October 2019-April 2020; School for Resources and Environmental Studies, Dalhousie University) in which I carried out a meta-analysis of all studies that characterise the microbial communities that colonise plastics - the "Plastisphere". 

My research interests lie in understanding the roles that microbial communities play in human and ecosystem health:
- How are these communities impacted by different factors of their environments? 
- How do they change over time? 
- What functions are they capable of carrying out?

My current research is focussed on: (i) the association between the microbiome and human health and disease; (ii) the remediation of human or ecosystem health threats by bacteria; and (iii) assessing and benchmarking the methods that we use to study microbial systems.
