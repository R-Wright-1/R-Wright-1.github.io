My name is Robyn Wright and I am a microbial ecologist/bioinformatician. I completed my BSc in Marine Biology at the University of Plymouth (UK) in 2013 before earning my PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of Warwick (UK) at the end of 2019. My background is in marine microbial ecology and I studied the colonisation and biodegradation of plastics during my PhD as well as in my first postdoc, where I moved to the School for Resources and Environmental Studies at Dalhousie University (Nova Scotia, Canada). I currently work as a postdoc within the lab of Dr. Morgan Langille, where my research aims to understand the roles that microbial communities play in human and ecosystem health and disease, and to assess and benchmark the methods that we use to study microbial systems. I enjoy working on diverse microbial ecology topics and several of my current research projects study the associations between the oral microbiome and mental and physical health conditions. I currently receive a fellowship from Mitacs for a collaborative project with SickKids on linking the oral microbiome with child and adolescent mental health.
